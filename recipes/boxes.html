        It isn’t complicated, but skipping over it now will cause you much frustration down the line.</span>
        
        <span class="second">Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another. 
            <a href="recipes/lasagna.html">Lasagna</a> 
            You can get a rough idea of how this works by sticking a border on every item on the page like this:
        </span>

        <span class="third"> OK, so there might be some circles in the above image… but when it comes to layout, they fit together like rectangular boxes and not circles. 
            <a href="recipes/lasagna.html">Lasagna</a>
             In the end, laying out a webpage and positioning all its elements is deciding how you are going to nest and stack these boxes.</span>
